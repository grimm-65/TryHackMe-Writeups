    Basic intro to malware RE

strings1.exe

**download and extract the binary**

Load the binary to ghidra\
check entry function which gives this function

![Alt command](./img/strings1ghidra.png)
From the entry function we get a partial flag

open on the toolbar menu window -> defined strings and search to get the flag

![Alt command](./img/strings1soln.png)

    strings2

load the binary strings2.exe into ghidra

![Alt command](./img/strings2ghidra.png)

We see alot of variables defined with only one _local_2c_ having a value of 'F' (maybe a hint)

hovering over each value in ghidra shows the ascii character represented

![Alt command](./img/strings2gh.png)

Covert each into ascii you get the flag

(Copy into chatgpt and prompt it to format it for you :)
)

    strings3

load the binary strings3.exe into ghidra

![Alt yo](./img/strings3ghidra.png)

At first glance it looks a little intimidating but we try to understand it piece by piece

In ghidra decompiled tab hover over the functions to get a brief overview of how it works if you have no idea what it means google :)

![Alt command](./img/strings3ghidra2.png)

Double clicking at a particular function takes you to the function

In decompile tab it is empty but it also shows some content on the assembly tab so i start looking into the assembly not for anything in particular but just trial and error

![Alt command](./img/strings3ghidra3.png)

While clicking on one of the functions and viewing the assembly code you get to see a partial flag

like we did in strings1 in defined strings
search for the partial flag we got and you will get the complete flag

N/B There are more ways to get the flag i simply found this to be the easy route with a bit of luck

To more deeply understand :

Research on all of the functions some are being called from other dll eg kernel32 and user32
