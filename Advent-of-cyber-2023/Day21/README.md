Challenge: DevSecOps II :)

        How larger CI/CD environment operates
        Indirect Poisoned Pipeline execution


        Today was a continuation of yesterddays intro to devsecops and an intro to jenkins 

        Platforms that handle pipeline build segments

            jenkins => Local automation server
            Travis CI => remote build server
              
        Both make use of agents/runners to build project
