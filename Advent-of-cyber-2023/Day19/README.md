challenge: Memory forensics

    Todays challenge was about memory foresnsics i was quite interesting 

    Analysis of a computers volatile memory (RAM)

    You get programs that were running when memory dump was created

    Volatile data examples running processes,network connections, RAM contents

    MemoryDump => snapshot of memory captured to perform memory analysis

        Tool used volatility.py

    TODO: Reasearch more on memory forensics ie android devices :)
